## Area Calculator

The Shiny application created for the course project calculates the area of a user-chosen shape and user-specified dimensions.

The application dynamically changes as the user changes the input of the various fields.

--- .class #id 

## How to Use the Calculator

Upon opening the application, the user will see that the default values are that the shape is square and the length is 0, thus giving an area of 0.

To change the shape, the user must click on the drop-down menu and choose the desired shape. The possible choices are square, rectangle, triangle, circle, and parallelogram.
